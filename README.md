# ICS-173_FInal_Project
Python Code for Final Project
Hoping I did this right, I used Jupyter to create the file attached to this project. I utilized SARS CoV-2 sequencing data created at the public health laboratory in Hawaii for the month of October. I created basic graphs but feel that I can do so much more and will continue to explore the visualization options I learned about throughout the semister. Stay tuned!!!
